Replicating the "ladder toss" backyard game

### What are the rules of the game?
- There are two teams each team has three tosses
- You can either score 0,1,2 or 3 points per toss (max of 9 points per turn)
- Both teams take their three tosses then points are tallied up
- Points are tallied by taking the difference of the two teams scores for that turn
  - EX: Turn one: team A scores 3, and team B scores 5, so team B is awarded 2 points
- You play to 21
